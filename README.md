# ðŸ¥” Potato Leaf Disease Detection using CNN
Developed a CNN-based model to classify potato leaf images into Early Blight, Late Blight, and Healthy categories.
Applied data augmentation techniques (rotation, zoom, horizontal flip, etc.) to increase dataset variety and reduce overfitting.
Performed image preprocessing steps like resizing, normalization, and label encoding for efficient model training.
# ðŸ“ˆ The model accurately detects diseases, enabling early diagnosis and improved crop health management.
